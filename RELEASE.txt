<Changes>

[7.3.0260]

1. Change delay load import library mechanism(libpq,openssl)
2. Compile Optimization correspondence.
3. SQLForeignKeys ResultSet accuracy correspondence.

[7.3.0258]

1. bug fix: SQLBulkOperations rollback option.
   There was a case where a rollback was not published in SQLBulkOperations 
   as option specification at the time of error generating.

[7.3.0257]

1. Fault correction of the division SQLGetData to SQL_C_WCHAR.

[7.3.0256]

1. SQLSetPos does not position to current-row to renewal of unblock cursor. 
   (Data is unacquirable by SQLGetData etc.)

[7.3.0255]

1. bug fix: leak of a return value clearance
2. Correspondence Windows English Dialog.
3. Changes into the libpq link method.

[7.3.0254]

1. Setting menu of SSLMODE is added.
2. Correspondence to domain type lo (an approvement is still required).
3. bug fix: LIBPQ version cancellation request transmitting correspondence.
4. Correction of the exclusive control between threads of SQLCancel

[7.3.0253]

1. Compilation of escape usage.
   (preliminaries corresponding to a literal-escape abolition schedule)
2. Correspondence of libpq and openssl.
3. SQLProcedureColumns()RESULT_COLS row is outputted.
4. bug fix: server-side prepare the number check of parameters.
5. bug fix: parameter bind without a parameter marker is disregarded.
6. bug fix: Retrying without carrying out a select operation to EWOULDBLOCK of socket/SSL-read.
7. Abolition of abolition in manual_result mode, TupleList, and TupleNode employment

[7.3.0252]

1. Bug fix: Multi-byte employment by a table name etc.
2. The text (varchar/char) type key assignation was enabled by MS-Access.

[7.3.0251]

1. Suppression of SQLColumnPrivilege support
   It rejects using information_schema.column_privileges.
2. Binary mode is used for a bytea type parameter value setup.
   (Performs by the sequence of SQLPrepare->SQLExecute by server_side_prepare employment)
3. Coexistence of LO type and bytea type.
   When the parameter of LongVarBinary exists not by SQLPrepare->SQLExecute but by 
   SQLExecDirect at the time of direct dispatching, the Parse/Describe function of 
   a protocol 3 is used, the model in saver of LongVarBinary is acquired beforehand, 
   and a bytea type and LO type are recognized.

[Feature of Driver7.3.025x]

1. Correspondence protocol 3
   Options, such as client encoding, are set up by the start-up packet.
   This makes the most of the mechanism of Parse/Bind/Execute.
   .The outfit of SQLDescribeParam
   .PREPARE/EXECUTE is changed from the command base to the protocol base.
   .FETCH command is changed to an Execute request as it has come out.
   .Moreover, bytea and lo type coexistence is possible.
   .Others...

2. Enhancement in declare/fetch mode (7.4 or later)
   Even if a certain renewal occurs on the way by holdable cursor exploitation, 
   a commitment is possible in comfort.
   Moreover, the static update cursor was supported.
   (Only for SQLSetPos correspondence, SQLBulkOperation are un-supporting)  
   Bug fix of the cursor which can be updated.

3. Rollback support of a syntactical unit at the time of an error.(8.0 or later)
   Can choose from three Transaction module,Statement module,Nothing.
   These can be specified by data source setup.

4. Output parameter support (8.1 or later)
   Corresponded to the output parameter of the function introduced by 8.1.
   (Only the return value of a function was supported before.)
